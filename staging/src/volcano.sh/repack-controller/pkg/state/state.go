// Package state holds the pure lifecycle logic of a RepackRun controller:
// deriving phase from conditions, gating Execute runs (global K=1 + cooldown),
// admission validation, and TTL/GC decisions. Everything here is a pure function
// of its inputs (no clientset, no informers), so the state machine is fully
// unit-testable and the reconcile loop stays a thin shell around it.
//
// Authority rule (§4.6): conditions are the source of truth; phase is a derived
// projection. Writers update conditions first, then recompute phase from them.
