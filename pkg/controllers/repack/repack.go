// Package repack registers the RepackRun lifecycle controller into the volcano
// controller-manager. The actual reconcile logic lives in the independent,
// framework-light module volcano.sh/repack-controller (depends only on the CRD
// types / generated client); this file is a thin framework.Controller adapter
// that builds it from the shared ControllerOption and runs it alongside the
// other controllers. Keeping the logic in a leaf module preserves "buildable on
// its own", while this shim gives the default "runs inside volcano-controller-
// manager" behaviour when Repack is explicitly enabled (registered like
// job/podgroup/queue). It is disabled by default because its CRD and RBAC are
// optional installation components.
