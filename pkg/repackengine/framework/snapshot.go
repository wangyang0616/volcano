// Package framework is the repack engine's plugin/action framework — the
// analogue of pkg/scheduler/framework. It defines the engine Session (a plugin-
// populated, action-consumed view of one repack pass), the Plugin and Action
// extension contracts and their registries, plus the commit (evict/nominate) and
// report plumbing. It depends only on pkg/repackengine/api (pure model) and
// pkg/scheduler/api (NodeInfo/TaskInfo) — never on the scheduler framework; the
// live-Session coupling lives in pkg/repackengine/adapter.

// concurrent reads during one pass.
